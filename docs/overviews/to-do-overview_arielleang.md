### Get started

> Have you [installed the To-Do service](../before-you-start-a-tutorial.md) in your development system? Make sure you have all the requirements in your system before you begin.

Let's start with a quick tutorial on enrolling a user. Since the **To-Do** service requires a user to create a task, this tutorial serves as a good jumping-off point to learn how to use the API.

Enrolling a new user in the service requires that you use the `POST` method to store the details of a new [`user`](../api/user.md) resource in the service.

**To enroll a new user:**

1. Start the service by using this command in your command-line tool.

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/to-do-service/api
    json-server -w to-do-db-source.json
    ```

2. Open the Postman app on your desktop.
3. In the Postman app, create a new request with these values:
    * **METHOD**: POST
    * **URL**: `{{base_url}}/users`
    * **Headers**:
        * `Content-Type: application/json`
    * **Request body**:
        You can change the values of each property as you'd like.

        ```js
        {
            "last_name": "Jones",
            "first_name": "Jenny",
            "email": "jen.jones@example.com"
        }
        ```

4. In the Postman app, choose **Send** to make the request.
5. The response body should look something like this. Note that the names should be the same as you used in your **Request body** and the response should include the new user's `id`.

    ```js
    {
        "last_name": "Jones",
        "first_name": "Jenny",
        "email": "jen.jones@example.com",
        "id": 5
    }
    ```

### Tutorials

Now that you've successfully [enrolled your first user](#get-started), you can take a look at tutorials for more operations in the service:

* [Create a new task](../tutorials/add-a-new-task.md)
* [Retrieve a list of users](../api/users-get-all-users.md)
* [Retrieve users by their user ID](../api/users-get-user-by-id.md)

### API reference

> The `{base_url}` value of the resources depends on the installation of the service.
>
> When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.
